# Reflection on Group Project Development:  

 

* The distribution process for the writing of the tests was very successful, we decided that for fairness we would split the work for the functions and tests in an alternate pattern e.g. for the functions we would have L B C standing for Lachey, Britiney and Cameron as for the corresponding tests would have C B L so no one in the team would be working on the same tests and functions, this was planned to encourage dialog between the tester and the implementer to ensure proper code is written. 

 

* One of the issues we as a group has identified is that we had issues with our pacing, in the beginning we were working in a relaxed pace, where as in the final week we realized that we really needed to ramp things up if we were going to finish on time, A positive strength that our group has shown was that we were always there when needed.  

 

* Another really big issue our group needs to work on, is that we need to make sure our individual functionality works beforehand and make sure small logic errors and syntax issues are fixed beforehand, so when time comes for us test our functionality we have an easier time instead of coming together and "group coding in the end"  to fix all the bugs and errors.
