# Minutes 21.02.21
* Start time: 1PM 

* Members: Daniel, Cameron, Lachlan 


## Discussion Points 

* 16 functions to be developed for iteration 1 

* Need to allocate them evenly (Use Python program?) 

* Allocate development and checking of each function 

* 1 or more people develop, 1 or more other people test each function 

* Some functions e.g. channel create, search_v1 should be high-priority (all members need to know their structure/operation) 

* Need to set regular team meeting times (Most likely Friday & Sunday each week as well as Wednesday lab session) 

## Rough outline of Week 2's meeting plans: 

* Wed ( Assign. Allocate Taks + Schedule)  

* Fri ( After trying coding ( writing pseudo code?), discuss questions, Feedback on Wed's Schedule..) 

* Sun ( Review on each one's rough code)
