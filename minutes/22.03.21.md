Discussion Points: 

As a group, created new branch to add files to repository, then merged into master: 

In src file: admin.py, notifications.py etc. 

Added helpers.py in src to enable common helper functions to be added later 

New data structures to be added to data.py I.e. dms and messages 

Discussed the helper functions that will be useful to simplify development of functions e.g. check_token to determine whether a token is valid 

Discussed division of test_implementation branches into separate branches for each test, to ensure good git practices based on iteration 1 feedback 

Discussed next steps I.e. developing assigned functions, developing server 

Action Items: 

Create separate branches for each test and move developed tests into their respective branches 

Begin development of functions
