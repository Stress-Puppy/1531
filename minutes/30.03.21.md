Discussion Points: 

Discussed appropriate method for using helper functions in main functions e.g. auth_login_v2 

Discussed remaining tasks to complete: 

Persistence 

Password hashing 

HTTP Tests 

HTTP implementation 

Questions to ask in project check-in: 

Is it necessary to ensure that the project matches the sample web-app exactly? 

How do we need to implement persistence? I.e. stores and reads every so often via the server or when functions are called. 

How should we handle deleted users' information I.e. should we remove their email etc. from their dictionary or leave it but allow it to be used to register a new user, or leave it and prevent the email from being used again? 

Should we write tests for the helper functions?  

Should the information of deleted users be accessible e.g. by user_profile? 

Return http error codes for errors 

Make sure the jwt is unique (use the timestamp of login) 

Use config.py to specify port number and tests and server should read from config.py 

To Do: 

Start writing HTTP tests to later start HTTP implementation 

Implement persistence
