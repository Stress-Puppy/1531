# Reflection on Group Project Development

The initial distribution process for the writing of the tests was very successful, due to us having 10 tests and 4 members it was difficult for us to decide on a completely even distribution, with that in mind we decided that some members will write 3 tests and some will write 2, with a follow up meeting on Friday for members to express any issues they had with the workload for any potential reshuffling.  

After finishing writing the tests and having each member doing a standup to explain what they have written. we decided that given some members implemented 3 tests and some 2, to ensure an even distribution of workload, we would reverse those numbers e.g. have those that implemented 3 tests, implement 2 functions so on.  

We also took into account the sequence of writing and testing functions  Auth_register, Auth_login, Channels_create given top priority. 

Making sure members that are the ones writing functions, are not the same as the ones writing the tests for that function was also something we agreed on, this was planned to encourage dialog between the tester and the implementer to ensure proper code is written. 
 
During the middle of week 3 an unexpected event happened where one of our members dropped the course with very little warning leaving us down to 3 members, this caused quite a bit of chaos, we as a group had to reassign everything from his tests (in case there was issues with them) to his functions. This process caused us to be behind schedule with people having less time to ensure correct implementation of said code, and interfered with the sequencing we agreed prior with some of Auth_register, Auth_login, Channels_create being unfinished leaving us with difficulty to test some of the other functions. To rectify this during the last 3 days of this iteration we had multiple team calls where we would engage in “pair programming” aka “group programming” aka “nice 4 hour chats” to sort out all the issues we were having and having the code function correctly.  

An issue we as a group have identified is that the timeline we have set in place for  

features lacks flexibility for any unforeseen circumstances that might arise, this for sure will be  something that we will take into account for iteration 2
