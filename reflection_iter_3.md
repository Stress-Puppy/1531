# Reflection on Group Project Development:  

The distribution process for the writing of the tests was very successful, we decided that for this iteration we would not split the functions and the tests we would work on the same functions and tests but each member will check and do standups explaining the tests and code they have written, and each member checking each other's code before merging.  

One of the issues we as a group has identified in iteration 2, is that we had issues with our pacing, we made sure to get started early in this iteration to insure we were not at a time crunch towards the end.  

Overall we as a group were satisfied with each other's cooperation as a team, learning from previous iterations we each wrote tests for or own code making sure things work. This reduced the need for a 12 hour group code session where minor clashes/bugs and syntax errors with the tests and the functions that needed to be fixed.  

A problem that has come to play in iteration3 was some server issues relating to CSE, Cameron had all his data deleted towards the end of the iteration (Luckly all code was pushed). So for future iterations, we would all push code from local reducing the dependency on things outside our control.
